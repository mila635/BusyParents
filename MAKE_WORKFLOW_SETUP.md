# Make.com Workflow Setup Guide

## Quick Fix - Workflow Integration Issue Resolved!

I've fixed the "Failed to trigger workflow" error by:

1. âœ… **Activated the trigger-workflow.ts API endpoint** (was commented out)
2. âœ… **Added proper environment variable configuration**
3. âœ… **Created complete Make.com workflow JSON** for import

## Import the Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Import the JSON Blueprint
1. Go to your Make.com dashboard
2. Click "Create a new scenario"
3. Click the "..." menu and select "Import Blueprint"
4. Upload the `make-workflow.json` file from this directory
5. The complete workflow will be imported with all modules connected

### Step 2: Configure Connections
After import, you'll need to connect these services:

#### Required Connections:
1. **Webhook** - Already configured with your URL
2. **Gmail Account** - Connect your Gmail for email processing
3. **OpenAI Account** - For AI email analysis
4. **Google Calendar** - For creating events from high-priority emails
5. **Google Sheets** - For logging processed emails

### Step 3: Update Webhook URL (if needed)
If Make.com generates a new webhook URL:
1. Copy the new webhook URL from Make.com
2. Update the `.env` file:
   ```
   MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL=your_new_webhook_url_here
   ```

## Workflow Features

The imported workflow includes:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Email Processing Pipeline**
- Triggers when your app calls the webhook
- Searches for unread emails in Gmail
- Processes each email through AI analysis

### ðŸ¤– **AI Analysis**
- Extracts priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Categorizes emails (School/Medical/Social/Work/Other)
- Determines if action is required
- Identifies deadlines
- Provides brief summaries

### ðŸ“… **Smart Calendar Integration**
- Automatically creates calendar events for HIGH priority emails
- Sets events for next day at 9 AM
- Includes AI analysis in event description

### ðŸ“Š **Google Sheets Logging**
- Logs all processed emails with:
  - Timestamp
  - Sender email
  - Subject
  - AI analysis results
  - Email ID for tracking

### ðŸ”„ **Status Updates**
- Sends completion status back to your app
- Updates workflow status in dashboard
- Tracks number of emails processed

## Testing the Integration

1. **Start your app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Activate the workflow** in Make.com
3. **Test the trigger** from your dashboard
4. **Check the workflow runs** in Make.com
5. **Verify results** in Google Calendar and Sheets

## Troubleshooting

### If workflow still fails:
1. Check Make.com scenario is "ON"
2. Verify all connections are authenticated
3. Check webhook URL matches in both places
4. Review Make.com execution logs for errors

### Common Issues:
- **Gmail connection expired**: Re-authenticate Gmail in Make.com
- **OpenAI quota exceeded**: Check your OpenAI usage limits
- **Calendar permission denied**: Ensure calendar write permissions
- **Sheets access denied**: Verify spreadsheet sharing settings
